---Questions
1. SVM problem of RBF kernel. Why distance is used in image recognition, the accuracy is so low?
2. How to build vocabulary for video data effectively? I mean the case when the data is too large

---Build vocabulary
167837 * 128 (sample rate = 100)
program falls when sample rate is set to 10 (Memory reaches 4GB)


---Video near duplication problem
/Users/GongLi/Dropbox/FYP/Duan Lixin Data Set/sift_features/Kodak/birthday/103_0337/
it seems that all frames are different, try it using another way which takes care of all features
